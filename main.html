	 <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to how efficient an algorithm is by measuring the amount of time it takes to run as the input size grows. Writing code with good Time complexity helps in building efficient solutions that perform well.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> describes how much extra memory an algorithm requires to execute. For example, an algorithm with Space Complexity of O(n) uses memory proportional to the input size.
